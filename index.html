            <h4>Instructions</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    Place rice in a fine mesh strainer and rinse under cold water until water runs clear (it will take
                    about 2
                    minutes of rinsing).
                    Tap bottom of strainer with palm of your hand until water no longer falls from strainer (it should
                    be well
                    drained).
                </li>
                <li>
                    Transfer rice to a medium saucepan along with 2 1/4 cups water. Bring mixture to a full boil then
                    reduce
                    heat to low,
                    cover with lid and simmer 15 minutes. Remove from heat, keep covered and let rest 10 minutes.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Meanwhile, in a small saucepan combine 4 Tbsp of the vinegar with the sugar and salt. Heat over
                    medium heat,
                    cook and whisk until sugar has dissolved.
                    Remove from heat, let cool while rice is resting then pour vinegar mixture over rice and toss to
                    evenly
                    coat.
                </li>
                <li>
                    In a small mixing bowl whisk together mayonnaise with sriracha. Transfer to a sandwich size
                    resealable bag.
                    Set aside.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Separately in a small mixing bowl whisk together soy sauce and remaining 1 Tbsp vinegar, set aside.
                </li>
                <li>
                    In a large mixing bowl gently toss together crab meat, cucumber, carrots, nori, ginger and avocado
                    OR keep
                    it separate and just divide chopped
                    ingredients into sections over a rice layer in serving bowls.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Divide prepared rice among 4 or 5 bowls. Top with crab mixture.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Spoon soy sauce mixture over top of each serving. Cut a small tip from one corner of the resealable
                    bag and
                    drizzle sriracha mayo over each serving.
                    Serve shortly after preparing (the avocado will start to brown).
